# journey-share-web

## Introduction
A mock community-driven trek-sharing web app.

Trekking is a niche hobby, you may find yourself in a close-knit group of friends where none likes trekking at all. JourneyShare aims to provide a platform where anyone can organize trekking trips, and hitch onto existing trekking trips organized by someone else. While trekking trips are organized by the community, JourneyShare aims to be a part of it by streamlining the process.
